Title: Welcome to librelist.com

Librelist is a free as in freedom mailing list site for open source
projects.  It is a place for FOSS communities to discuss all the things
they want without ads, censorship, signup requirements, bundled apps, or
requirements that you use any particular email client or service.

h2. Anyone Can Make A List

You can make a mailing list by simply sending an email to
*list*@librelist.com, and if it doesn't exist, it will make it for you
and subscribe you.  That's all there is to it, and no restrictions on
making the lists.


h2. Anyone Can Subscribe To A List

You also subscribe to a list by simply sending your first message to
*list*@librelist.com.  That's it.  It ditches your original message and
sends you a confirmation you reply to.  No signup or web forms involved.


h2. Spam And Bounce Blocking

Spam is heavily blocked on all lists to keep things clean.  We will
also periodically ban anonymous email services if they become a vector
for abuse.

Bounced emails are caught and anyone who bounces has all of their
subscriptions paused until they can fix the problem and reinstate
themselves.

h2. Archives via Rsync

All archives are accessible efficiently via rsync as maildir directories.
This means you can host your mailing list archives on your project's site
rather than directing users to Librelist.  Librelist also provides simple
archive browsing for smaller projects that can't host themselves.

You can read about it more in the "help":/help.html with more information
being planned.


h2. Support

You can get support and other help by either joining *meta@librelist.com*
or filing a ticket at the "support site":http://support.librelist.com/ 
if it's a bug or feature request.
