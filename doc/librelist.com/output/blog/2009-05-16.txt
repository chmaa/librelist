title: Lamson Project Site Launched

Today I launched the Lamson Project site at
"lamsonproject.org":http://lamsonproject.org/ and started filling in the
content.  Lamson is really turning into a fun and useful project, and hopefully
the site will get other people interested in it and using it.

I took the design from one of the many free web design sites and reused the same Python blog script that I use on "my own site":http://zedshaw.com/ so getting this up and running was cake.

Subscribe to the "RSS feed":/feed.xml and I'll soon be doing a blog post announcing mailing lists and other email services that I'll host on lamsonproject.org as well as new documentation and code drops.

If you browse around you'll find some useful documentation, but nothing complete just yet.  I'm still writing most of it.
