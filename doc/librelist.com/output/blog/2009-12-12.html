                <h2>A Few Updates To Librelist</h2>
                	<p>I&#8217;ve started working the <a href="http://support.librelist.com/rptview?rn=2">ticket queue</a> and managed to get out a few
little annoying things that people wanted or that were missing.  I&#8217;m still going to be doing
deploys today in my attempt to get things cleaned up further, but so far I&#8217;ve done the following:</p>

<pre>
=== 2009-12-13 ===
01:47:47 [3356e9d42c] *CURRENT* Stop altering the email addresses in the
         archives. (user: zedshaw tags: trunk)
01:40:30 [d7211e427a] The mailing list name is now added to the subject if not
         there already. (user: zedshaw tags: trunk)
01:29:33 [39d5ddc37b] New site layout done and pushed. (user: zedshaw tags:
         trunk)
=== 2009-12-12 ===
23:36:37 [cc081005a1] Added the librelist website code. (user: zedshaw tags:
         trunk)
=== 2009-12-01 ===
04:34:15 [0b6a443b36] Initial commit after moving from lamson project. (user:
         zedshaw tags: trunk)
04:32:14 [37f03800c8] initial empty check-in (user: zedshaw tags: trunk)
</pre>

	<p>What this means is there&#8217;s a new site that is clean and simple, some cleaned up docs that
will expand as I work on things, and a couple of new features:</p>

	<ul>
		<li>List names are prepended to the subject line like [meta] if it&#8217;s not in the subject already.</li>
		<li>The archives no longer mangle email addresses with <del>AT</del>.  It wasn&#8217;t helping and it made it too hard for people to archive.</li>
		<li>You can now CC or multi-To a librelist and it&#8217;ll get sent.  Previously I blocked these but too many people were doing it so I&#8217;m letting it go through.</li>
	</ul>

	<p>I&#8217;ll be trying to close out as many of those defects as possible, so stay tuned.</p>
