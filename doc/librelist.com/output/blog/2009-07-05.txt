Title: Site Launched

REST Inbox is my first product, so I'm looking for feedback on how
well you like what you're reading.  If you hate it, love it, or have
questions then "email me":mailto:zedshaw@zedshaw.com and tell me.

I'm planning on having a series of websites that use REST Inbox and "Lamson":http://lamsonproject.org/
to demonstrate what they both can do and how easy REST Inbox is to use.
I've already got a two in the works so stay tuned to get to play with them

After the demos I'll be doing a beta release of the project in order to get
interested people to play with it and try it out.  If you're interested in
participating in the beta, then "email me":mailto:zedshaw@zedshaw.com and I'll
talk with you about it.

I'm particularly looking for a web site that needs something like REST Inbox
and is interested in being an early trial customer for it.  I'd also like to
meet developers who want to play with it and give me feedback.

You can also "subscribe to the RSS feed":/feed.xml to watch for updates 
as I develop the site and the software.
