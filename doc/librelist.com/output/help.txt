h2. Subscribing

Subscribing to a list is easy.  Just send an email.  That's it.

If the list exists, then you'll get a confirmation and you'll
be subscribed, *with your original message going through*.  That
means you should make that first email count.

If the list doesn't exist, then you'll be given a list of possible
similar lists (in case you spelled it wrong).  If you really want
the list created, then just reply like normal and you'll get your
list, get subscribed, and have your first send in one shot.

h2. List Names

The names of lists can be characters, numbers, and dot ('.') characters.
*Nothing else.*  They also have to be *ASCII* characters.

h2. Unsubscribing

When you subscribe you get an email that tells you how to unsusbcribe
by sending an email to LIST-unsubscribe@librelist.com.  Of course
put the list you want to leave in place of LIST.  You'll get a confirmation
and then you'll be taken off.

h2. Archives

There's three ways to get archives.  First, just go to "/browser/":/browser/
on the site. This is a javascript browser of the archives.  Second,
you can go to "/archives/":/archives/ and get at the actualy javascript
that interface is using.  Feel free to use this as a template for your
own list.

Your project of course has full access to these archives, and they are fully
public, so that means you also get *rsync access* to the archives.  Simply
use @rsync -azv librelist.com::archives/LIST/YEAR/MO/DAY/queue@ and you'll get that
date as a Maildir queue.  When in doubt find the path you need using
the "web interface":/browser/ and go from there.

Of course, you can also grab the entire site's archives, or all of a list at
once, but don't be a jerk.  This service is provided for free, so if the
rsync is abused it will be taken off or restricted to trusted people.

To be nice, please ask on the "meta@librelist.com":mailto:meta@librelist.com
mailing list if you can grab all of a list.
