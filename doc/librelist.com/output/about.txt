Title: About librelist.com

<p>
This site is "my":http://zedshaw.com/ contribution back to the FOSS
community for giving me a long and varied career in software.  I
wouldn't be the programmer I am today if it weren't for the vast
amounts of good and bad code freely available to learn from.
</p>

This site will always be free for people, and will support itself
through donation drives periodically if it becomes a financial
burden to host.

The code to librelist.com is also available GPL licensed in the
"Lamson Project source releases":http://lamsonproject.org/releases/ 
so you can run your own if you want.

Enjoy!
