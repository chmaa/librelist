                <h2>Welcome to librelist.com</h2>
                	<p>Librelist is a free as in freedom mailing list site for open source
projects.  It is a place for <span class="caps">FOSS</span> communities to discuss all the things
they want without ads, censorship, signup requirements, bundled apps, or
requirements that you use any particular email client or service.</p>

	<h2>Anyone Can Make A List</h2>

	<p>You can make a mailing list by simply sending an email to
<strong>list</strong>@librelist.com, and if it doesn&#8217;t exist, it will make it for you
and subscribe you.  That&#8217;s all there is to it, and no restrictions on
making the lists.</p>

	<h2>Anyone Can Subscribe To A List</h2>

	<p>You also subscribe to a list by simply sending your first message to
<strong>list</strong>@librelist.com.  That&#8217;s it.  It ditches your original message and
sends you a confirmation you reply to.  No signup or web forms involved.</p>

	<h2>Spam And Bounce Blocking</h2>

	<p>Spam is heavily blocked on all lists to keep things clean.  We will
also periodically ban anonymous email services if they become a vector
for abuse.</p>

	<p>Bounced emails are caught and anyone who bounces has all of their
subscriptions paused until they can fix the problem and reinstate
themselves.</p>

	<h2>Archives via Rsync</h2>

	<p>All archives are accessible efficiently via rsync as maildir directories.
This means you can host your mailing list archives on your project&#8217;s site
rather than directing users to Librelist.  Librelist also provides simple
archive browsing for smaller projects that can&#8217;t host themselves.</p>

	<p>You can read about it more in the <a href="/help.html">help</a> with more information
being planned.</p>

	<h2>Support</h2>

	<p>You can get support and other help by either joining <strong>meta@librelist.com</strong>
or filing a ticket at the <a href="http://support.librelist.com/">support site</a> 
if it&#8217;s a bug or feature request.</p>
