                <h1>Welcome to librelist.com</h1>

                	<p>Librelist.com is a free as in freedom mailing list site for open source
projects.  It is a place for <span class="caps">FOSS</span> communities to discuss all the things
they want without ads, censorship, signup requirements, bundled apps, or
requirements that you use any particular email client or service.</p>

	<h2>Anyone Can Make A List</h2>

	<p>You can make a mailing list by simply sending an email to
<strong>list</strong>@librelist.com, and if it doesn&#8217;t exist, it will make it for you
and subscribe you.  That&#8217;s all there is to it, and no restrictions on
making the lists.</p>

	<p>If the list exists already, then you&#8217;re subscribed and your original
email is sent to them.</p>

	<h2>Anyone Can Subscribe To A List</h2>

	<p>You also subscribe to a list by simply sending your first message to
<strong>list</strong>@librelist.com.  That&#8217;s it.  It ditches your original message and
sends you a confirmation you reply to.  No signup or web forms involved.</p>

	<h2>Nobody Can Be Taken Off</h2>

	<p>The &#8220;libre&#8221; in the name means freedom for everyone to discuss their
opinions, so nobody will have the right to boot you off or enforce
arbitrary &#8220;list Nazi&#8221; rules simply because you disagree with them.</p>

	<p>That of course doesn&#8217;t mean you should act like a jerk, but the
librelist.com philosophy is that healthy communities can survive and
need &#8220;trolls&#8221;.</p>

	<h2>Spam And Bounce Blocking</h2>

	<p>Spam is heavily blocked on all lists to keep things clean.  We will
also periodically ban anonymous email services if they become a vector
for abuse.</p>

	<p>Bounced emails are caught and anyone who bounces has all of their
subscriptions paused until they can fix the problem and reinstate
themselves.</p>

	<h2>Current Status</h2>

	<p>As of <strong>19 <span class="caps">JUL</span> 2009</strong> the system is running and mailing lists are
functional, with bounce detection running.</p>

	<p>Archives are up in basic form at <a href="/browser/">/browser/</a> and there&#8217;s
also rsync access to the mailing list archives.  Mail put into the
archives is cleansed of most headers that don&#8217;t matter to the conversation
and the sender&#8217;s email address is spam-protected a little bit.</p>
