Title: Site Launched

"Librelist.com":http://librelist.com/ is the third "Lamson
Project":http://lamsonproject.org/ sample created to show off what
Lamson can do.  It is a fully functioning mailing list system with
advanced spam blocking and bounce handling.

If you want to play with it, send an email to
"test.list@librelist.com":mailto:test.list@librelist.com and you'll be
able to test it out with a bunch of other folks.

Over the next week I'll be doing releases of librelist.com to match 
Lamson releases, so more features will show up.  Top on the list
are the "archives":/browser/ and the "list of lists":/lists/ as well
as some tweaks to how mailing lists get created.

If you have suggestions, bring them up in test.list for now.  There will
be a new list shortly once librelist.com is out of beta.
